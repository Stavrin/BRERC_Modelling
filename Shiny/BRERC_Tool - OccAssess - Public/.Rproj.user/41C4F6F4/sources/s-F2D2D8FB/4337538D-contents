    # conducts these analyses for each time period, and uses the r2 value from the linear regressions 
    # as an index proportionality between range sizes and number of records. Higher values indicate 
    # that species' are sampled in proportion to their range sizes whereas lower values indicate that 
    # some species are over- or undersampled.
